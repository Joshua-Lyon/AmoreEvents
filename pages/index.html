<h2>WEDDING DJ</h2>

<p>So your big day is over? not just yet! The day time events have ended so it's 
    time to put on your dancing shoes and leave your evening entertainment in the 
    hands of the professionals. With over 15 years experiences and working hundreds 
    of weddings you can rest assured that you and your guests will be taken to 
    a boogie wonderland. Whether you want to dance among the clouds of light up the 
    room with one of our stunning lighting packages there is nothing that we can't 
    or won't do to make sure your big day ends with a bang. We help create memories 
    that will last a life time. Whatever your vision may be we can make it a reality.
</p>

<p>
    Prior to your big day we will offer a face to face meeting and will be contactable any day,
    any time to go over all the details and put any of your worries to rest. Your big day is just 
    as important to us as it is to you so we strive for excellence.
