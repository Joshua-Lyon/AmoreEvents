                    Steve kept our reception moving, and everything running smoothly. He kept the photographer in the
                    loop so she knew when
                    important things were happening. Our guests couldn't believe how amazing he was my husband and I
                    spent our night exactly how
                    we wanted - on the dancefloor with our friends and family. we never sat down the whole night.
